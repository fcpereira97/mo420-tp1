with minimum branch vertices, (2012).

EXCEL FILE
This file reports the results, of the models and the algorithms tested in the paper, for each instance (total of 400 instances). For the description of the table please refer to section 5.2 and 5.3 of the paper.

DATA SET
This data set is composed of two folders, Spd_Inst_Rid_Final2 and Spd_Inst_Rid_Final2_500-1000,
containing 
istances of the problem with size up to 500 vertices and up to 1000 vertices, respectively.

The name of each file describes the characteristic of the instance. 
The name is composed of a fixed prefix Spd_RF2_ followed by three numbers representing: 
the number of vertices, the number of edges and
the seed used to randomly generates the edges of graph.
For instance, the file Spd_RF2_10_15_11.txt 
contains a graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges and the seed used is 11. 

The content of each file is as follows:


- The first line contains the following three values:
	
	<Number of vertices> <Number of edges> <neglect this value>
	(Es. 10 15 0)
	

- The remaining lines contain the edges list of the graph:
	
	<extreme 1> <extreme 2> <neglect this value>
	(Es. 1 2 0)
	
N.B. The third value on each line of the file must be neglected.
